# See that the data is presented in a wide format where repeated measurements are contained in separate variables (only one row for each individual).
#Oftentimes, a longitudinal format, where repeated measurements are reported as separate rows, is preferable for the analysis. 
#The pivot_longer function is useful for restruring a data from a wide to a long format:

### Making the dataset ###
############################################

#let's go step by step
#"piping" is a way to do this in a MUCH CLEANER WAY. I will not use piping here as I think it's very difficult to follow unless you are familiar with it. 
#first make multiple rows per person
dental_long = pivot_longer(dental, cols = starts_with("y"), names_to = "measurement", values_to = "distance") 
dental_long
#pull ages to a numeric column
dental_long = mutate(dental_long, age = parse_number(measurement), measurement = fct_inorder(paste("Measure at age", age)))
dental_long
#make nice labels, this will be helpful when plotting
dental_long = set_variable_labels(dental_long, age = "Age of the child at measurement", measurement = "Label for time measurement", distance = "Measurement")
dental_long

### Time effect ###
############################################
#the function we use for a mixed model is lmer
#the specification looks almost like a regular regression with just an intercept term but 
#the +(1 | id) part is the part that tells it you want random intercepts. 
#It is saying that each id gets its own random intercept.
## This is the random intercepts model with fixed effects = indicators for age
lin_age = lmer(distance ~ measurement + (1 | id), data = dental_long)
summary(lin_age)

#note Satterthwaite's method and the use of REML
#notice the random effects and fixed effects portions of the results

#The mean dental distance at age 8 years (baseline) is 22.18 mm.
#The difference between the mean responses of 10 and 8 years-old children is 0.98 mm.
#The difference between the mean responses of 12 and 8 years-old children is 2.46 mm.
#The difference between the mean responses of 14 and 8 years-old children is 3.91 mm.

#you can get a confidence interval for the fixed effect terms
ci.lin(lin_age)

#you can test the variance components; this is testing whether there is significant evidence 
#that you need the random intercepts. If this was not significant, you could perhaps justify a #model only fixed effects.
ranova(lin_age)

#The emmeans function can be usefull for computing marginal means with corresponding confidence intervals.
tidy(emmeans(lin_age, "measurement"), conf.int = TRUE)

#now let's test if all beta's are 0 which means the distance is constant over time 
Anova(lin_age)

#Results from the Wald-test suggest that the trajectory of the mean response over time is not flat.

#We can show the estimated means at each age on top of the observed trajectories using the predict function. Here re.form = ~0 means no random effects. If you remove that part, you can see it puts a dot for each person.
